# Mounts

Mounts are a system that allow you to ride an animal, which enables much quicker movement around the world of Unora. The type of mount you select has a fixed speed; the speed at which a mount moves is not tied to the player's skill or level, but the animation of the monster model. They're unlocked through various means, which can be seen below.

Different mounts can be selected by accessing the Terminus menu (F1) and selecting "Mounts".

Along with mounts, cloaks can be seen when riding your mount and are purely cosmetic. There are a few different colors to obtain in the game today.

Change your cloak color by opening the Terminus menu (F1 > Mounts), selecting a mount and then choosing a color.
