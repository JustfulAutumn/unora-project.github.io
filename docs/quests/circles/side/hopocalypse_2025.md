- Bunny Hairpin (1,000,000 Gold)
- Bunny Muffs (1,000,000 Gold)

## Walkthrough

- To start the event, head to the side of the Undine Goods Shop and speak to Cadburry (17,25)
- Select "What happened, Cadburry?"
- Select "I'll get your eggs back!"

You learn that four bunny spirits (Hopscare, Petalpounce, Burrowglint, Whiskerflip) ran off with Cadburry's eggs. He asks you to get into the maze and find his eggs! They're hidden throughout the warren.

### How it works

This event works just like the game PACMAN. The four bunnies will sit in the middle of the maze and you'll spawn in a corner. Your goal is to collect all of the eggs in the maze. Collecting a golden egg will cause the bunnies to turn around and go back to the middle. The bunnies do have tracking and will attempt to corner you, so you will need to outsmart them!

There's a leaderboard by Cadburry to show the top players with regards to what stage they got to and how many eggs they collected.
