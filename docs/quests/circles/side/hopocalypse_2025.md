## Undine Hopocalypse

### Rewards

- Getting to level 3 of the maze rewards you with a "Chick Backpack" accessory
- Getting to level 5 of the maze rewards you with a "Cadburry (Backpack)" accessory
- Legend mark: Reached Level # of Hopocalypse

### Walkthrough

- To start the event, head to the side of the Undine Goods Shop and speak to Cadburry (17,25)
- Select "What happened, Cadburry?"
- Select "I'll get your eggs back!"

You learn that four bunny spirits (Hopscare, Petalpounce, Burrowglint, Whiskerflip) ran off with Cadburry's eggs. He asks you to get into the maze and find his eggs! They're hidden throughout the warren.

### How it works

This event works very similar to the game PACMAN. The four bunnies will sit in the middle of the maze and you'll spawn on one side of the map. Your goal is to collect all of the eggs in the maze, which will advance you to the next stage. Collecting a golden egg will cause the bunnies to turn around and go back to the middle. While walking back to the middle, they will turn white. Unlike PACMAN, touching a bunny will cause you to lose, so never touch them! The bunnies do have tracking and will attempt to corner you, so you will need to outsmart them.

There's a leaderboard by Cadburry to show the top players with regards to what stage they got to and how many eggs they collected.

You will receive a one-time reward based on how many levels you've completed.

### Shopscotch

Speak to Shopscotch (the bunny hopping around by Cadburry) and select "Eee! Show me the outfits!". Shopscotch sells the following items:

- Bunny Hairpin (1,000,000 Gold)
- Bunny Muffs (1,000,000 Gold)
