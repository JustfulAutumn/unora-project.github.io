## Walkthrough

### Part 1: Find the Mysterious Artifact

To start this quest, you must come across an item called a "Mysterious Artifact". This item is found randomly, but can be found walking around in the Mileth Crypt floors. It's been reported this can be found on floors 3 and 4.

Once you have the Mysterious Artifact, to proceed, you must join a [religion](./../../../religion/overview.md). Once you've joined one:

- Speak to the goddess that you're worshipping
- Select "Mysterious Artifact"
- Select "Take me there"
- You are teleported to the God's realm
- First, speak with Goddess Miraelis
- Select "I spoke to Zephyr"
- Select "Ignatar was helped by a summoner"
- Select "The summoner disappeared once the war started"
- Select "Zephyr said he still roams Unora"
- Select "Is there something I can do?"
- Select "How do I get around the barrier?"
- Select "Where do I find the Elemental Artifacts?"
- Select "What about the other artifacts?"
- Select "Thank you Goddess"
- You can choose to stay here or chat with the other Goddesses, although they have nothing useful to say at the moment

##### Summary

Miraelis explains that the summoner that helped Ignatar is pinned up on the 3rd floor of Eingren Manor and has protected the floor with a barrier. To get around the barrier, you must assemble the True Elemental Artifact. To do this, you must collect four artifacts and bring them to the Goddesses, which, with the other Goddess's help, Miraelis would be able to assemble.

The first artifact, the Earth Artifact, is held by the Earth Guardian in West Woodlands. She asks you to find this artifact first. Once found, the other Goddesses will assist with the other artifacts. You give Miraelis the Mysterious Artifact that you found so she can have it studied for anomalies.

### Part 2: Elemental Guardians

#### True Elemental Artifact

!!! note

    This portion of the quest will can be done solo.

- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "What else can I do?"
- Select "Yes Goddess"

Miraelis explains that in order to assemble the True Elemental Artifact, she will need **50 Coal** for the forge and **20 Ruined Iron** to make sure the artifact holds.

!!! tip

    The Tagor Forge (28,77) sells Coal at 100 gold each and you can farm Iron Deposits in West Woodlands. Refine the Raw Iron at the forge against the wall.

- Return to Miraelis with the items
- Select "I have the materials"
- Select "How much stronger?"

Miraelis requires you to be at least level 71 before proceeding further. If you are 71 or higher, speak with her again.

### Part 3: The Goddess' Trials

!!! note

    This portion of the quest **must** be done solo.

#### Trial of Combat

- Select "What are the other trials?"
- Select "I can handle it."

!!! warning

    Selecting "I am ready." will instantly teleport you into the trial. Be prepared!

- When you are ready to face the trials, select "I am ready."

Before sending you to fight the summoner, the gods have designed four trials you must overcome _yourself_. The trial of combat, the trial of luck, the trial of intelligence and the trial of sacrifice. In the event you fail a trial, you can retry every real life hour.

You have 10 minutes to defeat five waves of monsters:

- Hobgoblins
- Crypt Kardis
- Orc Warriors
- Gargoyles
- Slugs, Glupes, Bone Collectors

Monsters will spawn all around the arena. In order for you to proceed to the next wave, all monsters must be defeated.

- Once victorious, speak to Miraelis
- Select "I will go speak to Serendael."

Miraelis is impressed with how you handled yourself in combat and states that's what they're looking for. She directs you next to the trial of luck.

#### Trial of Luck

- Speak to Serendael
- Select "Is there any tips to pass?"
- Select "I will try."

The trial of luck consists of 3 rounds of picking the correct door. Wrong doors will teleport you back to the beginning and right ones will allow you to progress. This trial is purely luck-based; you will have 1 minute to complete it.

!!! tip

    Here's how this trial works:

    You will spawn into a hallway and must run forward until you see 3 doors spawn. Choose any door. If the door is correct, you'll see text in the communication window that says "The door opens and lets you through." If the door is incorrect, you will see "The door locks and sends you flying." If you get the first round correct, there are 5 doors on the second round and 8 doors on the third. If you get the door wrong, the door that was correct before will not be correct the second time. Every round is purely random. Just mount up and keep clicking doors until you get through.

- Upon completion, speak to Serendael
- Select "I will go speak to Theselene."

Serendael compliments your luckiness and lets you know that luck is needed when facing the Summoner. She tells you to speak with Goddess Theselene to take on the trial of intelligence.

#### Trial of Intelligence

- Speak to Theselene
- Select "Do you have any advice?"
- Select "I understand."
- Select "I am ready."

The trial of intelligence consists of an invisible maze. You must map out the maze to navigate through it. You get 5 tries before you are reset to the beginning, however it will not reset your progress in the maze. You have 8 minutes to complete the trial.

!!! tip

    Drop denominations of 1 gold on the ground to remember where you're going. Not every path you take will lead to the end of the maze. If you notice that the path you went down has no more choices, try a different starting point at the beginning and see where it takes you.

- With the maze solved, speak to Theselene
- Select "I will go speak to Skandara."

Theselene says that shadows quake in fear of you; the sheer intelligence you behold shows. She advises you to speak with Skandara for the final trial, the trial of sacrifice.

#### Trial of Sacrifice

- Speak to Skandara
- Select "What are your words of wisdom?"
- Select "I know."
- Select "I am ready."

The trial of sacrifice creates an environment where you will need to show that you have what it takes to risk it all. There will be 5 waves of monsters and Zoe will be their target. You must protect Zoe throughout the trial. You have 20 minutes to complete the trial.

!!! tip

    This trial starts with a little girl named Helpless Zoe in the middle of an arena. Waves of monsters will spawn and directly target Zoe. You will need to fend them off to keep Zoe from taking damage. She has a large health pool and can tank monsters for a bit.

    On the last wave, a dragon will spawn and start speaking. After about 10 seconds, the dragon will breathe a large frontal in front of him. Your need to position yourself directly in front of the dragon with Zoe behind you to shield her from the dragon's blast. This will complete the trial.

- With Zoe safe, speak to Skandara
- Select "That blast hurt..."
- Select "I will do that."

Skandara is impressed, even though the hydra knocked you out; that's what a soldier is all about. Zoe is safe and the hydra took after he realized he was too weak. She congratulates you and tells you to speak with Goddess Miraelis.

#### Back to Miraelis

- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "I will be on my way there."
- Select "I'll bring a party, thank you."

Miraelis shares that they have verified the location of the Summoner within the third floor of Eingren Manor. You will need the True Elemental Artifact to break the seal on the stairs. She mentions that the summoner isn't alone; there are multiple other bosses lurking around on the third floor. You will need a party to venture through there. Miraelis then hands you the True Elemental Artifact.

### Part 4: Search for the Summoner

!!! info

    If doing this with a fresh 99 party, you are going to want a balanced group of a Priest, DPS and possibly a tank. If a master is coming along with you, they will likely be able to solo the dragon.

- With the True Elemental Artifact, head to Eingren Manor with a party and go upstairs to 14,1
- Select "We are ready."

!!! info

    The third floor of Eingren Manor is huge with two extra bosses and then the summoner himself.

    Here are the locations to the two optional bosses and the summoner:

    - Possessed Knight (11,23)
    - Hollow (145,20)
    - Summoner Kades (28,185)

- (Optional) Defeat the side bosses
- Once ready, head to Summoner Kades
- Upon encountering him, he will display some dialogue:

> You are very bold Aislings. Coming into my home... This world is mine now. Return to which you came. I have other things to tend to, Servant! Get them!

- Kades will then summon his Servant, Morroc, and escape. Morroc explains during the fight:

> Nothing will stop master from summoning them! He will rule the world with the creants! Master is going to Cthonic Remains! He will rule the world with the creants!

!!! tip

    Unless you can take a hit, do not stand in front of Morroc! He has a strong fire frontal that will do massive damage to you.

Once Morroc has been slain, a portal will open that will take you back to the entrance at Eingren Manor. The True Elemental Artifact will have been consumed during this process.

- Head back to the God's Realm through your chosen Goddess temple
- Speak to Miraelis
- Select "He said the Summoner went to the Cthonic Remains"
- Select "Ok, I will wait."
- Select "How strong should I be?"


Miraelis mentions she will begin an investigation into what Morroc mentioned about the Summoner heading to the Cthonic Remains before having you go look yourself. She asks you to wait until the goddesses have more information.

- Speak to Miraelis again
- Select "What are Creants?"
- Select "Why are they so powerful?"
- Select "Why didn't you stop them?"
- Select "That's why Summoner Kades is down there."
- Select "How strong should I be?"
- Select "I will try."

Miraelis believes that Summoner Kades is headed to the Cthonic Remains to summon the creants. The Creants are mystical creatures that the Goddesses have spent centuries sealing away, too powerful to ever be killed. They represent four of the elements:

- Lady Phoenix, who has captured the wind
- Tauren, who has captured the earth
- Shamensyth, who controls fire
- Medusa, who dominates the flow of water

Shortly after the Goddesses created elements in Unora, these Creants came and used them for evil. Killing these Creants would be as difficult as killing the elements they created themselves; with the elements being a part of the goddesses themselves, they couldn't do it. Instead, one by one, they sealed the Creants away deep beneath the Cthonic Remains. It was done so long ago, the goddesses weren't sure anyone even knew about them until now. She mentions you must go down there and slay Summoner Kades for good this time, but you will need to be much stronger this time around.

_To start the next part of the quest, you will need at least 25,000 vitality before facing Summoner Kades again._
