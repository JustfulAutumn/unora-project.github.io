# Cooking

Cooking is a secondary profession in Unora that is able to be learned by all aislings.

## Where to learn

Head to the Kitchen in Mileth (54,33) and speak to Gendusa.

## How to Cook

Within the Kitchen, walk to the stove against the wall (2,9) and a shop window will open. Each dish has item requirements that must be met in order to craft. Cooking a dish does not ensure a 100% chance of success; it has a chance to fail with a mention of using rotten ingredients. The ingredients are not _actually_ rotten, but a notice that the craft has failed.
