# Priest

> Using magic to protect other sparks, you will grant blessing and heal wounds. Nothing will conquer your allies with you by their side.

## Mastering

You need 9,500 base HP and 13,000 base MP to master.

## Class Dedication (subbing)

You need 6,600 base HP, 6,250 base MP, 60,000,000 experience and 10 Strong Health Potions to dedicate to your class (sub).

If you find you're lacking in health, try pumping points into CON (+50 HP each) - just make sure you have 19 points left over!
