## Mechanics

The goal here is to get to the end of the dungeon and defeat the :material-emoticon-devil-outline:Forgotten Seer. Throughout the dungeon, you will come across :material-emoticon-devil-outline:Sanguine Reapers, which are mini bosses. Monsters and bosses in the dungeon have a low chance of dropping a key, which is used to unlock static chests throughout the area. Double-clicking the chests while you're next to them with a key in your inventory will open them, rewarding you with a random item.

### Final boss: Forgotten Seer

:material-emoticon-devil-outline:Forgotten Seer is the final boss found at the end of the rat hallway. He casts AoE attacks and summons different types of monsters you've seen throughout the dungeon. Casters should keep their distance from the boss and ideally have their backs against the wall (and standing next to each other if possible to reduce how many monsters could potentially attack them.)

The :material-emoticon-devil-outline:Forgotten Seer casts summons in this order:

- First set of summons: 7 Scarlet Succubus
    - These can randomly cast Tidal Breeze (AoE). Keep your casters away from these
- Second set of summons: 20~ Rats (extremely dangerous)
    - These will slaughter your casters and must be tanked as best as possible. Your Monk should save their AoE taunt for this
- Third set of summons: 2 Forgotten Seers
    - Your Monk will be taking very high damage with these and boss on them

He will pramh (sleep) and dall (blind) random players throughout the fight.
