## Chapter I: Terminus, the First and the Last

Before time, before light, before existence itself, there was only Terminus, the Goddess of Time and Endings. Not a creator, not a destroyer, but the eternal witness—an entity that simply was, marking the edges of all things.

In the vast nothingness, Terminus moved through the void, not shaping it, but defining it, setting the foundation for what would come. She did not breathe life, nor did she cast shadow, but she ensured that one day, all things would find their conclusion in her.

Yet, in her endless solitude, something stirred. A force that would shatter the emptiness and bring the first light to the void.

## Chapter II: The Birth of Light and Darkness

From the stillness, a radiance broke through the void. A force of warmth and creation, Aurelia, the Goddess of Light and Life, emerged. Her presence filled the emptiness, illuminating the void with her brilliance. With her arrival, the concept of beginning was born.

Yet, where there is light, shadow must follow. From the edges of Aurelia’s radiance, Tenebris, the God of Darkness and Shadow, took form. Unlike Aurelia, who sought to spread and create, Tenebris embraced the silence, drawing power from the spaces in between, shaping the first shadows in Unora.

The two clashed, not out of hatred, but out of necessity—day and night, warmth and cold, radiance and abyss. Their struggle defined the first days of existence, shaping the ebb and flow of balance.

Their endless battle tore through the void, and from their struggle, something new emerged.

## Chapter III: The Coming of Death

From the chaos of their conflict, Sgrios, the God of Death and Decay, was born. Neither light nor dark, Sgrios was the inevitable conclusion of all things. Where Aurelia breathed life, and Tenebris cast shadows, Sgrios ensured that nothing would last forever.

His arrival marked the natural order: a cycle of birth, growth, decay, and renewal. Though neither Aurelia nor Tenebris welcomed him, neither could deny his necessity. Without him, the world would spiral into unchecked creation or endless stagnation.

With Death’s presence, Unora became more than a battlefield of light and dark. It became a world where things could truly exist, change, and end.

But it was still barren—a land of warring forces without form. And so, from the ripples of existence itself, new gods began to emerge.

## Chapter IV: The Arrival of the Elemental Gods

With the balance of Light, Darkness, and Death established, the world needed shape. It needed land, sky, and sea. And so, the Elemental Gods arose:

- Ignatar, the God of Fire & Creation, was the first spark of passion, igniting the stars and warming the void.
- Geolith, the God of Earth & Strength, formed the mountains and carved the bones of the world.
- Zephyra, the Goddess of Wind & Change, stirred the skies and gave breath to the world.
- Aquaedon, the God of Water & Dreams, shaped the oceans, rivers, and the deep mysteries of the world.

Together, they forged the foundation of Unora, a world of flame and stone, wind and waves. A realm no longer trapped in the battle of light and dark, but one where creation could truly begin.

Yet, as the world took form, conflict did not cease—it only evolved.

## Chapter V: The Dawn of Conflict and Balance

With the world formed, other gods arose—beings shaped not by the raw elements, but by the nature of existence itself.

Skandara, the Goddess of War and Conflict, emerged from the first battles between light and dark. Wherever Aurelia and Tenebris clashed, Skandara thrived, forging strength from struggle. In her wake, battlefields formed, and the will to fight became woven into the fabric of existence.

In response, Miraelis, the Goddess of Mercy and Peace, was born. Where war threatened to unravel creation, Miraelis mended it, bringing harmony to the strife and soothing the wounds left behind. She instilled the first acts of kindness and the desire for unity, tempering the ceaseless march of war.

Yet, war and peace alone did not govern the world. Theselene, the Goddess of Mystery and Fate, arose from the unseen currents that guided all things. It was she who wove the hidden threads of destiny, ensuring that nothing in Unora was purely by chance. The whispers of the unknown became her domain, shaping omens, dreams, and the unfathomable secrets of existence.

But where fate sought order, Serendael, the Goddess of Chance and Chaos, emerged as its foil. Unpredictable and untamed, Serendael disrupted the careful balance, introducing fortune, misfortune, and the unexpected twists of fate. She was the gambler, the storm, the shifting tides of luck that mortals and gods alike could never fully control.

Together, these gods completed the cycle of existence. Conflict and peace, destiny and chaos, light and dark, life and death—all intertwined in an eternal dance.

And beyond it all, Terminus watched, neither interfering nor ruling, but ensuring that, in the end, everything—gods, mortals, and even the world itself—would return to her.

Thus, the world of Unora was truly born, a realm of gods and mortals, forever shaped by the endless interplay of forces both seen and unseen.
