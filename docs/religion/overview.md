# Overview

Religion is tied closely to the [lore](../lore/overview.md) revolving around Unora. There are currently 4 goddesses in which you can devote yourself to that provide various buffs when enough faith is used to perform a divine blessing:

- [Miraelis](./miraelis.md)
- [Serendael](./serendael.md)
- [Skandara](./skandara.md)
- [Theselene](./theselene.md)

## Joining a religion

Speak with the goddess at the temple you're choosing to devote yourself to and select "Join the Temple". The Goddess will request you to bring them 3 Essence of <Goddess Name>. Speak to them again once you have the essence and select "Essence of <Goddess Name>". You are now a worshipper and have received a <Goddess> stone in your inventory.

!!! tip

    "Essence of ..." items will occasionally drop from monsters while hunting.

## Praying

You can pray to a goddess up to 6 times per day. Each prayer will give you:

- A small amount of experience
- A chance to obtain an essence of the goddess you worship
- Faith points

Once you've consumed all of your prayer charges for the day, you must wait 22 hours before praying again.

## Faith

Faith is obtained by praying. You can see how much faith you have by checking your legend under "Worshipper of <Goddess> (X)". Faith is used as a currency for buying passports and asking your goddess to perform a divine blessing. To pray, you can visit your goddess and select "Pray", or use the <Goddess> stone given to you when you joined the temple.

## Passports

Passports can be obtained by either speaking to the goddess you worship or using your <Goddess> stone and selecting "A Path Home". These are "songs" that allow you to teleport back to your home location. They cost 1 faith per passport.

## Divine Blessings

Divine Blessings are buffs issued by your goddess that cost a fixed number of faith points. You can check the pages on the left for your goddess for additional details on what each goddess's buff does and the duration for each.

## Parting from a religion

You can freely part/change  religions, but know that you will lose all faith in the religion that you're leaving.
