# Overview

Religion is tied closely to the [lore](../lore/overview.md) revolving around Unora. There are currently 4 goddesses in which you can devote yourself to that provide various buffs when enough faith is used to perform a divine blessing:

- [Miraelis](./gods/miraelis.md)
- [Serendael](./gods/serendael.md)
- [Skandara](./gods/skandara.md)
- [Theselene](./gods/theselene.md)

## Joining a religion

"Essence of ..." items will occasionally drop from monsters while hunting. One use of these essences is to bring 3 of them to the temple of the goddess you wish to devote yourself to, which will allow you to join.

## Parting from a religion

You can freely part, or change, religions, but note that you will lose all faith in the religion that you're leaving.
